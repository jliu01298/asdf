\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my final project, I needed to figure out how to populate a 2d array with just 1 value at a random location that did not have a value. I had my ducky with me and looked long and hard into his eyes while asking what effect I wanted to achieve under what conditions. After listing out all of the factors needed to make it happen, I planned out what I needed to do and wrote some rough code. After fixing the bugs using the errors with my ducky, my method finally worked.}
